This group project was a part of the Machine Learning 2 course at Northwestern University, Integrated Marketing Communications Master's Program. 
Using logistic regression and random forest, we aimed to explore the variables that affect students' performance in  math class. 
As a result of the analysis, we developed recommendations for stakeholders on how to support students.
